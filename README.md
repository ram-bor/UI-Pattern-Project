## UI Pattern

You will need to pick a UI pattern from the list below and an API. You'll then
build out the UI pattern you chose to work with the API you chose.


#### Modal

When a user clicks on a link, a box should appear in the center of the screen
with the details for the item that the user clicks on. The box should have some
way for the user to close the box and see the full list of items.
