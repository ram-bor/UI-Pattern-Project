## UI Pattern & API

The User Interface pattern that I used for this website is a modal window. Simply hover over an image and click to display a modal containing an enhanced image of a cocktail along with its information. An X signifies the button to close the modal window. 

For the API, I used data from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php and a few images sourced from https://unsplash.com/ since a few images were blurry and outdated.
